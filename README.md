# TuiFangKuai - A sliding block game

### Background

This is a remake of one of my favourite puzzle games from childhood. This was one of the pre-installed games on the Sony Ericsson T100, and I spent a lot of time solving the puzzles, eventually completing all the levels and wishing there were more.

Out of interest, I went on a hunt for its name in English, and found it here  in [this review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtXvN3HpOKg)

Surprisingly, it is simply listed as 'Q'! I couldn't find very much about this game, but in any case, here is my take.

### The Remake

The original 'Q' game, charming as it was, ran on a black-and-white LCD screen.

I've given it a major upgrade, moving from 2D to 3D graphics, and using physics for movement.

Now with colours as well, the lighting and effects are mostly done with custom shaders.

I've also added an editor, which I don't remember the original game having. You can save and load custom levels.

### Demo

I've hosted a demo [here](https://radiositymap.github.io/tfkbuild/), but the game is currently work in progress.
